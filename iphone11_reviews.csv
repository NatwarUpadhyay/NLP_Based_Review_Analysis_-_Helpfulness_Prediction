Not a very big difference between 12 except for the OLED screen and a very minor camera improvement which is you cant make a difference. If you are planning for a iPhone and you have budget you definitely can go for this without second thoughts. Now some people are complaining and giving review 0 or so because there is no charger and headphones but thats been already mentioned so I assume they are illiterate. Its not that Flipkart is removing them duh. Anyways bee...,247,18,5

Apple ecosystem adds to the value if you have other Apple products. Display is not on par with Amoled panels but it's bright and punchier enough. LCD display aids to better battery life I guess.

5,Sarath Chandra Poodi,Terrific purchase,1/3/2020,Terrific purchase,Good phone but an LCD screen in a premium device spoils the overall experience. Hope they fix it with an OLED screen in the next iPhone.The max has an OLED screen but is needlessly expensive with little more to offer as I feel the premium apple justifies is more for iOS than the hardware.This was a gift and the the user is quite happy with the product. Also the included charger is woefully slow and takes too long to charge the phone.Overall 4.5/5Screen 2/5,0,0,0

Charging this phone takes lifetime. it took my phone 2 hrs to reach from 21% to 74%. 2. Almost same specs design and built quality as XR3. Product Red is basically Lipstick Red totally different from XR.4. I would rate 0 of 10 in the area of innovation. There is nothing new other than IOS 13 which is full of BUGS. 5. It very heavy around 200 gms and gets heavier if you add cases and covers.,197,118,0

Delivery experience - I ordered this product on 21st Jan 2020 & the product was shipped on 25th late evening. Received on 28th Jan 2020. Walk into an Imagine store & you’ll get amazing offers there compared to here. Rather Retailers like Reliance Digital might give you additional discounts.

Only downgrade thing if you buy iphone is its battery it heats little bit and if you play games it only give you 2-3 hrs battery life then again charge other wise 15-16 hrs day life Otherwise phone is great,8,2,0

The conclusion is you can blindly go for it. Cheers ✌️,1,0,0

I thought of initially upgrading to the latest OnePlus phone but seeing the negative remarks/opinions I changed my mind and went for iPhone and eventually felt it was a good decision.  It will take some time to adjust to iPhone if you are an android user but truly you will love it after some time.Camera and performance of  iPhone is superb.,2,0,0

4,Praveen Soman,Wonderful,1/12/2019,Wonderful,i was confused between 11 and 11 pro. i was going towards 11 pro but the screen size was not enough for me. And i saw 11 in the showroom. i didn't find much difference in screen quality.And cameras seems to be ok with me.  And i saw offer's in flipkart and made the purchase.the device is fabulous. The hardware and software quality is excellent. The new iOS is something you need to experience yourself. The drawback i found was absence of fast charger but the pricing can compensate that.

4,Amit Kumar Behera,Wonderful,1/10/2020,Wonderful,If I consider it just as a smartphone it's pretty expensive. Have to admit that I payed a lot of money just for the brand. I understand people use apple products for years and if we consider the time span the phone is also worth for the money. But there are also phones available under 10k and runs for years. Yes it is true.Buy this phone only if you want to show others how much you earn otherwise it's nothing but just a smartphone like others are.,3,2,0

Takes wonderful images and the stabilisation of video on this phone is just awesome although it is a 2019 model. Performance wise it’s ultra fast as expected to be. The only drawback per paper is the screen it has but in usage I noticed nothing bad and the screen was totally fine for me!I upgraded from Nokia 6.1 Plus and it’s great 🤩,6,2,2

5,Borsita Singha,Excellent,1/6/2022,Excellent,Okay so I’ve been using this phone for about two weeks and I have to say this is by far one of the coolest phones I’ve ever used. The camera quality is excellent security is amazing and the battery is quite alright. It depends upon the user. If he/she is a heavy user and has a screen time of 8-10 hours the battery might be a little issue for you but if you’re someone who has a screen time of 5-6 hours like me this is a great purchase. I would definitely recommend you to go for it.,1,0,0

No doubt its a good phone however it comes with 5W charger which is pretty slow for this phone. Upon checking I found phones which sold out of india having a 12W charger in the box. It’ll take upto 3hrs to charge the phone to 100%. Charger hold a important place for any phone we cannot wait for a long time to charge a phone. I know this will not change anything but just want to share it.,1,0,0

The packaging was pathetic. The phone box was simply sealed inside a flimsy flipkart plastic bag and delivered. Expected at least a better packaging for such fragile items. Also especially since the piece I got was the first batch of iphone delivery in India via prebooking expected some care at least. Would have given 5 stars for the product. ...,13,11,0

The main focus of apple phones is camera and I have been using One Plus 7 pro for the past two years and believe me with perfect mods and google camera One Plus beats iPhone 11. Iphone is indeed very handy and looks premium. On the other hand if I am investing 50k might as well find everything perfect with my phone. Conclusion - ...,2,3,0

In this amount others are giving far far better than apple. One of the myth is it never gets lag but others get after a couple of years. But in a couple of years everyone changes his mobile than why should we bother about lagging of phone. In a nutshell apple should do a lot for improving its performance,5,4,0

Ram management and storage management is good. Display is ips lcd without any refresh rate so that’s could be a cheaper side in terms of display for investing more than 40k on mobile.

5,Arjun Jagadeesh,Worth every penny,1/6/2020,Worth every penny,I have been using Iphone 11 for a week the battery lasts a day easily with average 10hrs of screen ON time. The performance is just superb and I face no heating issues as mentioned in many reviews I saw. The only time my phone heats is when connected to a 18W Apple fast charger which I bought separately. I havent tested the camera yet. Display may be low in specs but it wont be felt to your eyes. Overall a moderately low priced Iphone with Battery Backup and Excellent performance.,2,5,0

But when it comes to heating problem it always gets heated for a while in every 20 minutes of usage which I don't understand why?  Also there's a specific place below the camera you can feel the heat is lot more than other areas of back of the phone. If you think that iPhone is something which you always wanted to have only then buy it otherwise there are better options available in the market.,2,1,0

So either get this or wait for MicroLED to become mainstream in 4-5 years least. And the mind blowing battery life is simply out of the world in current market let alone A13 Bionic.,2,10,0

4,sagar agrawal,Nice product,1/11/2022,Nice product,The previous generation iPhone design is quite classic. No wonder the whole industry follows apple. Buying iPhone 11 in 2022 is a not a great decision. It has neither a full hd screen nor 5G support. But the camera is top notch. Software glitch is minimal. Works flawlessly. Does the basic things powerfully. It may not have the ease of android but it is trustworthy. I am done with the android phones hanging up in two years and no software support from the makers.,0,0,0

5,Achyut Banerjee,Terrific,1/11/2022,Terrific,Good phone on the cheap. Got 4 of them at BBD sale and converted the entire family onto iphones. For the phone itself it is a good phone IF it's your secondary device. The screen is flabbergasting the cameras are so-so and battery backup is okay. Build is good and iOS is great and smooth. Will serve well for next 2/3 yrs,0,2,0
