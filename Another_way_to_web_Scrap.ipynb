      "review_text_full:Finally got the decent game pad. Before this i had the x box wired controller. Its was good no doubt but after a month it was not working at all. I decided to buy a wireless but the price was tooo high..... Later i saw this red gear pro. The price was fair enough. I bought and no doubt it is awesome the button nd vibration nd the best part  backlid buttons. Enjoyed a lot. Played fifa , gta 5, nfs rival. Experience was smooth like butter...!  Thanks again for this product Flipkart.READ MORE\n",

Buttons are awesome however they shouldn't have included backlit buttons and in home key because they eat up battery (even with this battery lasts a long time). You need to have a clear sight between the reciever and controller and when it is blocked controller stops working.All games work perfectly with it as it seems to be recognised as a Xbox 360 controller.READ MORE\n",

No lag between inputs. If you are confused between wired or wireless, buy wireless without any thinking. Battery is awesome and you can play even with wired which helps in charging and dongle which acts as wireless.READ MORE\n",

      "review_text_full:Worked fine on linux. Just plug and play. I tested in steam, rpcs3,and heroic launcher.worked in all three.  Tested games Days gone, tekken 7. Plastic is not so great . Its average,. The size of the controller feels small but that depends person to person, I think it has a low connectivity issue, as i was just 1mtr away from my pc and connection lost between gameplay and connected itself.overall its good for price. It's a first day review. I hope this controller will last long.READ MORE\n",

I didn't have any experience with gamepads and this made it possible.It came out of the box with low battery but got charged in a few hours and has been running for about 8 hours without showing the need for a recharge. The buttons and triggers are nice and there hasn't been any connectivity issues. I still prefer to use mouse n keyboard for fps games but as far as rpg games are concerned I'm starting to prefer this gamepad.READ MORE\n",

This gamepad doesn't require any installation bit directly recognised as Xbox gamepad.The vibration is superb. It will make you feel like you are really there in a battlefield.2hours of charge gives 10hours of service. Battery life is extreme and you get a extra dongle just for emergency.....So buy this and feel yourself a premium one.My only complain agains...READ MORE\n",

Charged it on 30th and i use it for 1-2 hours daily, its 3rd june now and it hasn't died yet. So minimum battery life should be 4-5hrs which isnt bad. The only thing to keep in mind is the safety of that dongle, thats the reason i reduced a star, excluding that everything is just perfect.READ MORE\n",
